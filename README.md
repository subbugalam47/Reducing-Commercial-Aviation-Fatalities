# Reducing-Commercial-Aviation-Fatalities
##Introduction
My problem statement was a kaggle competition which is organized by Booz Allen Hamilton company on Kaggle. Booz Allen Hamilton has been solving for business, government, and military leaders for over 100 years. Most flite related fatalities originate from lack of airplane state awareness.That implies ineffective attention management on part of pilots who may be distracted , sleepy or in other dangerous cognitive states.Our challenge is to build a model to detect troubling events from aircrewâ€™s physiological data
